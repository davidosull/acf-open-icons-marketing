        "Fixed": [
          "**Tabler Icons Path Structure**: Fixed issue where some Tabler Icons (including rosette-discount variants) were not loading. Tabler Icons now organizes icons in `outline/` and `filled/` subdirectories instead of directly in the `icons/` directory. The plugin now correctly fetches icons from `icons/outline/{key}.svg` (default) and falls back to `icons/filled/{key}.svg` if needed. This ensures all Tabler Icons variants load correctly."

        "Fixed": [
          "**\"Use Last Color\" Context Isolation**: Fixed \"Use Last Color\" feature to properly isolate color storage per instance of flexible layouts and repeaters. Previously, all instances of the same layout type shared the same last color, causing new instances to incorrectly inherit colors from previous instances. Now each layout instance and repeater row has its own isolated storage.\n  - Flexible layout instances now use unique instance identifiers (supports both numeric and alphanumeric IDs used by ACF)\n  - Repeater rows are isolated per row index/ID\n  - New instances start with default color token until a color is explicitly selected in that instance",
          "**Admin Preview Color Updates**: Fixed issue where admin post edit screen showed old colors after palette token values were updated in settings. The preview now regenerates SVG from the current `colorToken` and palette settings, ensuring it always displays the current color values. The stored SVG in the database is also updated when saving the post."

        "Technical Improvements": [
          "**Instance Index Extraction**: Improved context detection to extract flexible layout instance IDs and repeater row IDs from ACF input name paths, supporting both numeric and alphanumeric identifier formats",
