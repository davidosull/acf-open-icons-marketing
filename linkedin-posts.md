## Post 1: The Icon Problem (Problem-Focused)

Are you still managing icons in your WordPress media library? 📁

If you're using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), you know the struggle:

- Cluttered media library
- Manual file management
- Inconsistent icon styles across projects

There's a better way.

ACF Open Icons gives you access to 8,500+ professional icons from Lucide, Tabler Icons, and Heroicons—all integrated directly into your ACF workflow.

No media library clutter. No frontend overhead. Just clean, professional icons that work seamlessly with WordPress.

## Post 2: Zero Frontend Overhead (Technical Value)

Here's something most WordPress developers don't think about: icon performance.

Most icon solutions require:

- External CDN calls
- Additional frontend scripts
- Extra HTTP requests
- Slower page loads

ACF Open Icons works differently.

Icons are stored directly in your ACF field data as SVG markup. No external dependencies. No CDN calls. Zero impact on your site's performance.

Your icons render server-side with a simple PHP function: `acf_open_icon()`

That's it.

For developers who care about performance and clean architecture, this matters.

One license. Unlimited sites. $5/month or $40/year.

## Post 7: Quick Win - Color Tokens (Feature Highlight)

Here's a feature that saves me hours: Color Token System.

Instead of hardcoding icon colours, ACF Open Icons uses palette tokens (A, B, C) for dynamic colour management.

Change your colour scheme once, and all icons update automatically.

Perfect for:

- White-label client sites
- Theme customisation
- Brand consistency across projects

No more searching and replacing hex codes. No more inconsistent colours.

Just clean, maintainable icon management.

8,500+ professional icons. Smart caching. Powerful search. Migration tools.

All for $5/month or $40/year with unlimited activations.

## Post 8: The Real Cost of Managing Icons (ROI)

Let's talk about the real cost of managing icons in WordPress.

**Traditional approach:**

- Finding icons: 10-15 minutes per project
- Uploading to media library: 5 minutes
- Organising files: 5 minutes
- Updating icons later: 10-20 minutes
- **Total: 30-45 minutes per project**

**With ACF Open Icons:**

- Search and select: 2 minutes
- Done.

**Time saved: 25-40 minutes per project**

If you build 10 sites a year, that's 4-7 hours saved.

At $5/month ($60/year), that's less than $10 per hour of time saved.

Plus you get:

- 8,500+ professional icons
- No media library clutter
- Zero frontend overhead
- Unlimited site activations

The math is simple.

External icon solutions? Too complex.

I spent hours managing icon files, updating them, keeping them organised.

There had to be a better way.

So I built ACF Open Icons.

8,500+ professional icons. Zero frontend overhead. No media library clutter. Developer-friendly interface.

Everything I wished existed when I was struggling with icons.
